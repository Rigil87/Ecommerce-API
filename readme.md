## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- MySQL
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Marshmallow
- Marshmallow-SQLAlchemy
- SQLAlchemy
- MySQL Connector

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rigil87/Ecommerce-API.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up MySQL database:**

   Ensure you have MySQL installed and running. Create a database for your project.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_api;
    ```

5. **Update configuration:**

   Update your `app.py` with the correct MySQL connection string.

    ```python
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/ecommerce_api'

## Testing

1. **Run Database Setup:**

   Ensure that calling `db.create_all()` creates all required tables in MySQL.

2. **Use Postman:**

   Create a Postman collection and add a request for each of your API endpoints to the collection. Then export the collection and include it in your project folder.

3. **Verify Data:**

   Use MySQL Workbench to ensure data is being correctly stored in the database.
